# kempe

Kempe is a stack-based language and compiler.

I wrote this to learn how to write a compiler backend.

Inspiration is primarily from [Mirth](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth).

## Installation

For shell completions but the following in your `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.bash_profile`:

```
eval "$(kc --bash-completion-script kc)"
```
